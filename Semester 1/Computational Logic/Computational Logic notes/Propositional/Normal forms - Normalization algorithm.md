- **CNF** - I guess same thing as DNF but put a **NOT** outside to transform from a $\lor$ to $\land$ by the De Morgan's law right? hope so
	-  And ofcourse, each clause from the CNF provides an **anti-model**, since even if only a clause is **FALSE**, it leads to **FALSE**, because 0 AND'ed with others will still be 0 at the end.
