### To prove a theorem, follow these steps:

1. Use the **reverse of the T. of deduction** to get a deduction like `H1, H2, ..., |- C`
2. Prove the **deduction** obtained using the **definition of deduction**
3. Use the **T. of deduction** to get the premises to the right to get back the theorem form (`|- U`)

If the deduction at step 1 has n premises, `H1, ..., Hn`, using the theorem of deduction we can bring them to the right side in `n!` ways.
