- Clearly, when f of the $\alpha$'s is 0 in DCF, then the cube will be FALSE, as 0 is part of the conjunction, so we can give it up, it doesn't add anything to the disjunction:
- In the same manner, when f of the $\alpha$'s is 1 in CCF, the clause is always TRUE, and it doesn't add ANYTHING to the conjunction:

- And so as we can see, if the values of the f are 1 in the DCF, it doesn't add anything to the conjunction so only the variables remain, same thing in , 0 doesn't add anything to the conjunction
