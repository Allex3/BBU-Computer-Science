## Tasks:
#### 1. Arithmetic Operators
- Bit subtraction and addition, despite the fact it does multiplication and division (more expensive to do), so addition is used instead of multiplication, and subtraction can be used instead of division
#### 2. Bit-shifting operators
#### 3. Logical operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT
- bit-by-bit operations from a logical point-of-view
##### ! The ALU will set accordingly, the values from the EFLAGS register
###### Computer on n bits
- The software vision - "word size" = size of the registers on the architecture (on 32-bits)
	- The software vision that we embrace means the size of the general registers, it means the size of the "word size", which in our case it's 32 bits
- The engineering vision
