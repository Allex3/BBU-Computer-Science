## [[Operation errors - push, pop, memory]]  - MANDATORY FOR EXAM

## Error types in Comp Science - agnostic of language!

### **ASSEMBLY ERROR** = Syntax Error - diagnosed by assembler / compiler ! - eroare de asamblare
- because an assembler generates bytes 

### Run-time error (execution error) - program crashes - it stops executing
- e.g.: **Stack overflow**

### Logical error = program runs until its end or remains blocked in an infinite loop ... if it functions until its end, it functions LOGICALLY WRONG obtaining a totally different result/output than the envisioned ones

### Fatal: Linking Error  !!! 
- For example, in the case of a variable defined multiple times in a multimodule program ... if we have 17 modules, a variable must be defined ONLY in a SINGLE module ! If it is defined in 2 or more modules, a "Fatal: Linking error - Duplicate definition for symbol..." will be obtained!

### The steps followed by a program from source code to run-time:
- Syntactic checking (done by **assembler/compiler/interpreter**)
- **OBJ** files are generated by the **assembler/compiler**
- **Linking phase** (performed by a **LINKER** = a tool provided by the **OS**, which checks the possible **DEPENDENCIES** between the **OBJ files/modules**). The result is, in windows, **.EXE** file
- You (the user) are activating your exe file by clicking or entering
- The **LOADER** of the **OS** is looking for the required RAM memory space for your EXE file. When finding it, it loads the EXE file AND performs ADDRESS RELOCATION - ==loading phase==, where are the data segments of the program, their `file descriptor`
- In the end the loader gives control to the processor by specifying THE PROGRAM's ENTRY POINT (ex: start label) !!! The run-time phase begins now!
