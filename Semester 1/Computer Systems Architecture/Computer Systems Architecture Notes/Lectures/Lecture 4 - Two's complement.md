[[2's Complement]]
Only **2** situations in which **two's complement** is applied, and **why**?
question - requirement - why it is necessary

##### Remark:
The two's complement is **always** involved **in** working with ==**negative numbers**==
It is a ==mechanism for **representing** binary numbers in an architecture==, and needed **only** when working with negative numbers!

### Motto of the course: 
With 2's complement, ==We interpret representations and represent interpretations==:
	**representation** in base 2 of a (positive/negative) number
	**interpretations** in base 10
	**representing interpretations**: -17 to base 2 -> use 2's complement
	**interpret representation**: from 2's complement signed representation to base 10, so it's translated for us
