>[!question] Explain and exemplify how negative numbers are represented and operated on at the level of the 80x86 architecture. Showcase the representation mechanism and give 2 adequate representation examples (example: discussion and analysis on the representation of -37 and -912, etc.) How cat the corresponding value in base 10 for a representation in base 2 be obtained? Which are the possible practical methods / techniques / mechanisms to be applied? Present how the programmer operates with negative numbers at the level of the assembly language in the case of each of the 4 basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (1 adequate source code example for each basic operation + explanations). Present and exemplify (by adequate code sequences) every assembly language instruction (or category of instructions, if they are very similar) capable of operating with such numbers (1 example for each instruction / category + explanations for each). How is the value 0 considered and why
