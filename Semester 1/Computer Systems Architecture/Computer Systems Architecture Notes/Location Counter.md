 **Location counter** - an integer number managed by the assembler for very separate memory segment. At any given moment, the value of the location counter is the number of the generated bytes correspondingly with the instructions and the directives already met in that segment (the current offset inside that segment). The programmer can use this value (read-only access!) by specifying in the source code the '$' symbol. 
 **Every segment has its own location counter!!**

**Examples**:
```nasm
Segment data
	a db 17, -2, 0ffh, 'xyz', ...

	lga equ $-a ; the following line is the same line.. that's why comment
	;lga dw $-a  ; now lga is a variable (offset, DS:lga)
	;lga dw $-$$ ; works now because a is the first element defining that segment. does not work generally
	;lga dw $-data ; does not work in NASM, syntax error 

	b equ 27 ; b is NOT AN OFFSET!!! IT'S JUST A CONSTANT
	; lga dw b-a ; SYNTAX ERROR!
	
	;c dd ....
	;lga dw c-a ; WORKS!!
	;lga dw lga-a <=> lga dw $-a
```
