1. The number of partitions on a set A = {1, 2, 3} is 5
2. using the notation ∆A = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)], the partitions on a set A = {1, 2, 3} and their corresponding equivalence relations are:
{{1, 2, 3}} ⇝ A × A
{{1, 2}, {3}} ⇝ ∆A ∪ {(1, 2), (2, 1)}
{{1, 3}, {2}} ⇝ ∆A ∪ {(1, 3), (3, 1)}
{{1}, {2, 3}} ⇝ ∆A ∪ {(2, 3), (3, 2)}
{{1}, {2}, {3}} ⇝ ∆A
